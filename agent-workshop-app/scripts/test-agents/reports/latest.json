What is a generic type? Answer briefly.\nResponse:\n\nA **generic type** in TypeScript is a type that can work with multiple data types rather than a single one. It allows you to create reusable components that can operate on various types while maintaining type safety.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Uses angle brackets `<T>` where `T` is a placeholder for the actual type\n- The actual type is specified when the generic is used\n- Provides flexibility without sacrificing type checking\n\n**Simple example:**\n```typescript\n// Generic function\nfunction identity<T>(value: T): T {\n  return value;\n}\n\nidentity<string>(\"hello\");  // T is string\nidentity<number>(42);       // T is number\n\n// Generic interface\ninterface Box<T> {\n  content: T;\n}\n\nconst stringBox: Box<string> = { content: \"text\" };\nconst numberBox: Box<number> = { content: 123 };\n```\n\nGenerics enable you to write code that works with any type while TypeScript still knows what specific type you're working with at compile time.",

What is a generic type? Answer briefly.\nResponse:\n\nA **generic type** in TypeScript is a way to create reusable components that can work with multiple data types while maintaining type safety.\n\nInstead of specifying a concrete type, you use a type variable (commonly `T`) as a placeholder that gets replaced with an actual type when the code is used.\n\n**Simple example:**\n```typescript\n// Generic function\nfunction identity<T>(value: T): T {\n  return value;\n}\n\nidentity<string>(\"hello\");  // T is string\nidentity<number>(42);       // T is number\n\n// Generic array type\nconst numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];\nconst strings: Array<string> = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\n```\n\n**Key benefit:** You write the code once, but it works for many types while the TypeScript compiler ensures type correctness throughout.",

What is a generic type? Answer briefly.\nResponse:\n\nA **generic type** in TypeScript is a way to create reusable components that work with multiple types rather than a single one. It's like a placeholder for a type that gets specified when the component is used.\n\n**Simple example:**\n```typescript\nfunction identity<T>(arg: T): T {\n  return arg;\n}\n\n// T becomes 'string'\nidentity<string>(\"hello\");\n\n// T becomes 'number'\nidentity<number>(42);\n```\n\n**Key benefits:**\n- **Type safety**: You maintain type information throughout your code\n- **Reusability**: Write one function/class that works with many types\n- **Flexibility**: The actual type is determined at usage time\n\n**Common syntax:**\n- `<T>` - type parameter (T is convention, but can be any name)\n- `Array<T>` - generic array type\n- `Promise<T>` - generic promise type\n\nThink of it as a \"type variable\" that lets you write code that adapts to whatever type you need while keeping TypeScript's type checking intact.",
